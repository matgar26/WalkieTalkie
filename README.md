# WalkieTalkie

The goal of this exercise is to understand how you think and work through problems which may not have a clearly defined go-forward path. As this is a senior role, it is our expectation that you are able to discover a user’s needs, technology’s constraints, and choose the best path forward. 


The deliverable for this challenge is a walkie-talkie app, where users may send and receive short “voice messages” to one another. Because we expect this app will be used frequently, please allow for a robust history page where users can see all of their past communications, both outgoing and incoming. If a user is an admin, that user may view all messages.


In addition, please add a “search” feature, to allow users to find specific messages, or sets of messages. To assist with this, we’ve created a small repository, which you can use as your mock backend (https://github.com/fluentstream-sandbox/walkie_talkie_backend). You’ll find all the endpoints you should need in that repository. 


For iOS, please use the Build Target version of 14.4. On the history page, please implement functionality for the list to refresh when the list is pulled down. Any “View” code should be completed in SwiftUI.


While they’re not mission critical objectives, bonus points for considerations for accessibility, device sizes, and a consistent color/theme. 


There is no right or wrong deliverable, and no magic “correct” solution we are looking for.  We are trying to simulate our real remote work development environment, so you can get an idea of how we work, and we can get the same from you. 

We are interested in how you communicate remotely, solicit feedback, drive discussion, think about problems, handle areas you don’t know well, and how you think about/work through design decisions.

The skills we are assessing in this process are:

Async Communication
Research / Design
Coding
Autonomy / Ownership
Expectation Management
Customer/Product Focus
Attention To Detail
